            <h3>Other Recipe Sites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">New York Times Cooking:</a></strong>
                    Contains a homepage to browse recipes, as well as various categories for holidays, food styles, moods etc.
                    Image focused to allow user to see what the end product will look like, and also includes cook time without having to navigate to a specific recipe page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://www.blueapron.com/cookbook">Blue Apron</a></strong>
                    Also image focused, and also has the ability to filter by main ingredient and cuisine type. Has search
                    functionalty for those who know what they are looking for. Also has clear markers for vegetarian dishes. Clean UI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">Budget Bytes</a></strong>
                    Focused on the cost of the recipe, which is a nice addition. Shows the cost breakdown of the entire recipe as well
                    as per serving. Has similar filters as the previous websites, but also adds a cost option. Again, very simple and clean
                    UI that places the emphasis on what the food will look like, drawing the user in.

            <h3>Other Non-Recipe Sites</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://www.gq.com/gqsports">GQ Sports</a></strong>
                    Simple and clean UI, great use of white space without feeling to empty. An unobtrusive nav bar that makes it easy
                    to get from page to page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://us.supreme.com/pages/shop">Supreme</a></strong>
                    Incredibly image focused, going so far as to only show images on the main shop page without any text. Organized in a
                    unique layout, and could be used to draw some inspiration from.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a></strong>
                    Has a unique homepage and recommendation features, which could be interesting to implement for a recipe website. The
                    sidebar design is also nice, and could be incorperated to house category selection or other similar elements.
