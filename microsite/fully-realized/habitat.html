                <p>The giant panda is endemic to China. It is found in small, fragmented populations in six mountainous
                    regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. Successful
                    habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers, though loss of habitat due to human activities
                    remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of medium-to-large-sized mammals—such as
                    domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscape—the giant panda population is generally low.
                    This is mainly attributed to the panda's avoidance of interspecific competition.</p>
                <p>The species has been located at elevations of 2,400 to 3,000 m (7,900 to 9,800 ft) above sea level.
                    They frequent habitats with a healthy concentration of bamboos, typically old-growth forests, but may
                    also venture into secondary forest habitats. The Daxiangling Mountain population inhabits both
                    coniferous and broadleaf forests. Additionally, the Qinling population often selects evergreen
                    broadleaf and conifer forests, while pandas in the Qionglai mountainous region exclusively select upland
                    conifer forests. The remaining two populations, namely those occurring in the Liangshan and
                    Xiaoxiangling mountains, predominantly occur in broadleaf evergreen and conifer forests.
                </p>
                <p>Giant pandas once roamed across Southeast Asia from Myanmar to northern Vietnam. Their range in China
                    spanned much of the southeast region. By the Pleistocene, climate change affected panda populations, and
                    the subsequent domination of modern humans led to large-scale habitat loss. In 2001, it was
                    estimated that the range of the giant panda had declined by about 99% of its range in earlier
                    millenniums.</p>
