            <p>The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo
                forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally
                solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her
                range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity
                to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.
                Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and
                dusk; however, pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning,
                afternoon and midnight. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently,
                and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day. Activity is highest
                in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following
                March. Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days. There is a
                significant interaction of solar radiation, such that solar radiation has a stronger positive effect on
                activity levels of panda bears.</p>

            <p>Pandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine.
                They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent
                dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will
                instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather
                than visual memory. Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack
                humans on rare occasions. Pandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to
                protect themselves against cold temperatures.</p>
            <p>The species communicates foremost through a blatting sound; they achieve peaceful interactions through
                the emission of this sound. When in oestrus, a female emits a chirp. In hostile confrontations or during
                fights, the giant panda emits vocalizations such as a roar or growl. On the other hand, squeals
                typically indicate inferiority and submission in a dispute. Other vocalizations include honks and
                moans.
